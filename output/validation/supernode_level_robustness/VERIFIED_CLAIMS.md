# VERIFIED CLAIMS - Cross-Prompt Robustness Analysis

## ✅ VERIFIED: All Claims Checked Against Raw Data

Generated: 2025-10-27
Based on: Dallas vs Oakland probes (state capital retrieval)

---

## 1. Universal Concept Transfer: **100.0%** ✅

**Claim**: All task-invariant supernodes transferred between probes.

**Evidence**:
```
7/7 universal supernodes present in BOTH probes:
  - (capital) related
  - (containing) related  
  - capital
  - containing
  - is
  - of
  - seat
```

**Interpretation**: These represent genuine semantic/relational primitives, not probe-specific artifacts.

**Confidence**: HIGH - Perfect transfer rate with no exceptions.

---

## 2. Entity Separation: **100.0%** ✅

**Claim**: All entity-specific supernodes showed appropriate non-transfer.

**Evidence**:
```
8/8 entity-specific supernodes appeared in ONE probe only:

Dallas probe only:
  - Dallas (15 features)
  - Texas (25 features)
  - (Texas) related (10 features)

Oakland probe only:
  - Oakland (15 features)
  - California (20 features)
  - (California) related (5 features)
  - United (5 features)
  - (United) related (5 features)

Inappropriate transfers (both probes): 0
```

**Interpretation**: Perfect disentanglement of task structure from entity content.

**Confidence**: HIGH - Clean separation with zero entity bleeding.

---

## 3. Feature Overlap: **12.8%** (25/195 features)

**Claim**: Low feature overlap indicates high entity-specificity.

**Evidence**:
```
Shared features: 25 out of 195 Dallas features (12.8%)
Dallas-only features: 170 (87.2%)
Oakland-only features: 205 (89.1%)
```

**Interpretation**: Most features encode specific facts; few encode general operations.

**Confidence**: HIGH - Directly measured from data.

**Important Context**: Low overlap is EXPECTED and GOOD - it shows the model doesn't just use generic features for all capital retrieval, but recruits entity-specific representations.

---

## 4. Activation Stability: **94.2%** ✅

**Claim**: Shared features show highly stable activation profiles.

**Evidence**:
```
Mean relative activation difference: 0.058 (= 94.2% similarity)
Mean sparsity difference: 0.040
Peak token same: 22/25 (88%)
Peak type same: 24/25 (96%)
```

**Interpretation**: Shared features exhibit robust, context-independent behavior.

**Confidence**: HIGH - Low variance across all metrics.

---

## 5. Grouping Consistency: **68.0%** ⚠️

**Claim**: Most shared features grouped into equivalent supernodes.

**Evidence**:
```
Consistent grouping: 17/25 (68%)
Inconsistent grouping: 8/25 (32%)
```

**CRITICAL CORRECTION AFTER REVIEW**:

Of the 8 "inconsistent" cases:
- 6 cases: `Say (Austin)` ↔ `Say (Sacramento)` - **CORRECTLY DIFFERENT** (entity-specific output)
- 1 case: `Texas` ↔ `California` - **CORRECTLY DIFFERENT** (entity features)
- 1 case: `Say (capital)` ↔ `California` - **GENUINELY INCONSISTENT** (ambiguous feature)

**Adjusted interpretation**: 
- **Truly inconsistent**: 1/25 = 4% (one ambiguous feature)
- **Correctly entity-dependent**: 7/25 = 28% (features that should differ)
- **Genuinely consistent**: 17/25 = 68% (universal features stable)

**Confidence**: MODERATE - Requires manual review of "inconsistent" cases to distinguish genuine inconsistency from appropriate entity-dependence.

**Revised Claim**: Among shared features, 96% (24/25) behave correctly - either consistently grouped (17) or appropriately entity-dependent (7).

---

## 6. Layer Stratification Pattern ✅

**Claim**: Hierarchical processing with universal early features and entity-specific late features.

**Evidence**:
```
Layer-wise overlap (of Dallas features):
  Layer 0-1:   80-92% overlap  → High universality
  Layer 7-12:  67-100% overlap → Mixed processing
  Layer 16-22: 0-50% overlap   → Entity-specificity
```

**Interpretation**: Expected gradient from universal to specific representations.

**Confidence**: HIGH - Clear pattern visible in data.

## SUMMARY: What Can We SAFELY Claim?

### ✅ **Strong Claims** (High Confidence)

1. **Perfect universal transfer** (100%, n=7)
   - "All task-invariant supernodes transferred between probes"
   
2. **Perfect entity separation** (100%, n=8)
   - "Entity-specific supernodes showed complete non-transfer"
   
3. **High activation stability** (94% similarity, n=25)
   - "Shared features exhibit highly stable activation profiles"
   
4. **Hierarchical layer organization** (clear gradient)
   - "Overlap declines from 92% (early) to 0-50% (late layers)"

### ⚠️ **Moderate Claims** (Require Caveats)

5. **Feature-level consistency** (68-96% depending on interpretation)
   - **SAFE**: "68% of shared features grouped consistently into universal supernodes, with an additional 28% showing appropriate entity-dependent variation"
   - **AVOID**: "High feature-level consistency" (without explaining the 32%)

6. **Low feature overlap** (12.8%)
   - **SAFE**: "Low overlap reflects high entity-specificity, consistent with factual knowledge encoding"
   - **AVOID**: "Most features transfer" (they don't - and shouldn't!)

### ❌ **Overclaims to Avoid**

1. ~~"Near-perfect feature-level consistency"~~ → Only 68% if naively counted
2. ~~"High feature overlap"~~ → Only 12.8%
3. ~~"All shared features behave identically"~~ → Some should differ (entity features)

## RECOMMENDED TEXT FOR PAPER

### Results Section (Conservative, Verified)

> Cross-prompt testing revealed **100% semantic transfer** for universal supernodes (n=7: copula, prepositions, relational operators) and **100% appropriate non-transfer** for entity-specific concepts (n=8: state/city names). Among 25 shared features (12.8% of Dallas probe), **94% exhibited stable activation profiles** (mean relative difference 0.058), with **68% grouped into equivalent universal supernodes** and an additional 28% showing appropriate entity-dependent variation (e.g., `Say (Austin)` → `Say (Sacramento)`). Layer-wise overlap declined from 92% (layers 0-1) to 0-50% (layers 16-22), confirming hierarchical processing with universal early features and entity-specific late features.

### Discussion (Interpretation)

> The perfect separation between universal and entity-specific supernodes provides strong evidence against overfitting: universal concepts transferred completely while entity concepts showed zero inappropriate transfer. The low feature overlap (12.8%) reflects high entity-specificity in GPT-2, where most features encode particular facts rather than abstract operations. The few shared features with high activation stability (94% similarity) likely represent core computational primitives that generalize across factual domains.

### Limitations (Honest)

> While supernode-level transfer showed perfect discrimination (100% universal transfer, 0% entity bleeding), feature-level analysis revealed moderate grouping consistency (68%), with 32% of shared features receiving different supernode assignments. However, manual review indicates that 7 of these 8 "inconsistent" cases represent appropriate entity-dependent variation (e.g., `Say (Austin)` vs `Say (Sacramento)`), leaving only 4% (1/25) genuinely ambiguous. The low feature overlap (12.8%) limits statistical power for feature-level analysis; future work should test additional probe variations to identify truly universal features.

## BOTTOM LINE

Your claims are **SOLID** for:
- Supernode-level transfer (100% perfect)
- Activation stability (94% high)
- Entity disentanglement (100% perfect)
- Hierarchical organization (clear gradient)

Be **CAREFUL** with:
- Feature-level consistency (68% naively, 96% after correction)
- Interpreting "low overlap" (it's good, not bad!)

**Overall assessment**: Strong, publication-quality evidence for robust concept discovery. Just need to be precise about what "consistency" means at the feature level.
