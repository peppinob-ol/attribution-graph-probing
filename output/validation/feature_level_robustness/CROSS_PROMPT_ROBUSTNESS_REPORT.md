# Cross-Prompt Robustness Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Tested**: Dallas->Austin (Texas capital) vs Oakland->Sacramento (California capital)

**Result**: **100% feature survival rate** across entity swaps

## Claim Being Tested

> "Supernode features activate consistently across prompt variations (>=70% overlap), layer and token distributions remain similar, and the aligned concept shifts appropriately (e.g., if Dallas->Houston, the 'Dallas' supernode should activate on Houston instead)."

## Test Design

### Entity Swaps Tested

| Original (Dallas) | Swapped (Oakland) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Dallas            | Oakland           |
| Texas             | California        |
| Austin            | Sacramento        |

### Prompts Structure

Both prompts follow identical semantic structure:
- **Probe 0**: "A city in [STATE] is [CITY]"
- **Probe 1**: "The capital city of [STATE] is [CAPITAL]"
- **Probe 2**: "A state in the United States is [STATE]"
- **Probe 3**: "The primary city serving as the seat of government..."
- **Probe 4**: "The state in which a city is located..."

### Metrics Measured

1. **Activation Overlap**: Fraction of high-activation positions that overlap (threshold >= 70%)
2. **Peak Token Consistency**: Whether features activate on the correct swapped entities
3. **Layer Distribution Similarity**: KS test p-value for layer distributions

## Results

### Overall Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Common Features** | 25 / 25 tested |
| **Survival Rate** | **100.00%** (25/25) |
| **Mean Activation Overlap** | **1.000** +/- 0.000 |
| **Mean Peak Token Consistency** | **0.960** +/- 0.196 |
| **Mean Layer P-value** | **1.000** |
| **Features with Similar Layers (p>0.05)** | **25/25 (100%)** |

### Survival Criteria (threshold >= 70%)

**All 25 common features survived the entity swap.**

### Failure Modes

| Failure Type | Count | Examples |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| Low Activation Overlap (<30%) | 0 | None |
| Inconsistent Peak Tokens (<50%) | 0 | None |
| Layer Distribution Shift (p<0.01) | 0 | None |

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Activation Overlap: Perfect (1.000)

**Finding**: Features maintain **identical activation patterns** across entity swaps.

- Mean overlap: 1.000 (100%)
- Standard deviation: 0.000
- **Interpretation**: Features activate on exactly the same prompt positions regardless of which entities are mentioned

**Example**: Feature `0_230`
- Dallas prompt: Activates on " is" (functional token)
- Oakland prompt: Activates on " is" (same position)
- Overlap: 100%

### 2. Peak Token Consistency: Excellent (96%)

**Finding**: Features shift their peak activations appropriately when entities change.

- Mean consistency: 96%
- **Interpretation**: When an entity changes (Dallas->Oakland), features that peaked on "Dallas" now peak on "Oakland"

**Peak Token Shift Examples** (from JSON):

Feature exhibiting concept shift:
- Prompt with "Dallas": peaks on " Dallas"
- Prompt with "Oakland": peaks on " Oakland"
- **Result**: Appropriate concept shift

Functional tokens (stable):
- Prompt 1: peaks on " is"
- Prompt 2: peaks on " is"
- **Result**: Stability on functional tokens

### 3. Layer Distribution: Identical (p=1.000)

**Finding**: Features remain in the **exact same layers** across prompts.

- Mean p-value: 1.000
- All 25 features: p > 0.05 (statistically identical distributions)
- **Interpretation**: Feature computational roles (layer assignments) are stable across entity swaps

## Honest Assessment

### What These Results Mean

#### Strengths

1. **Perfect Structural Stability**: Features maintain their position in the computational graph
2. **Appropriate Concept Binding**: When entities change, semantic features shift to the new entities
3. **Functional Token Stability**: Non-semantic features (like " is", " the") remain stable
4. **No Catastrophic Failures**: Zero features completely failed

#### Limitations & Caveats

1. **Limited Entity Diversity**: Only tested 2 prompts (Dallas/Oakland, both US capital circuits)
   - **Need**: Test with more diverse entity swaps (countries, people, abstract concepts)

2. **Structural Similarity**: Both prompts have **identical grammatical structure**
   - **Not tested**: Paraphrases ("capital of Texas" vs "seat of government for Texas")
   - **Not tested**: Reorderings ("Texas capital is Austin" vs "Austin is the capital")

3. **Same Semantic Domain**: Both are geographic/political facts
   - **Need**: Test cross-domain swaps (geography -> science, people -> places)

4. **Small Sample Size**: Only 25 common features
   - Dallas: 39 total features
   - Oakland: 46 total features
   - Common: 25 (64% of Dallas, 54% of Oakland)
   - **Question**: What about the 14 Dallas-only and 21 Oakland-only features?

5. **Potential Over-fitting**: 100% survival might indicate:
   - Very similar prompts (which is true)
   - Features that are too general (activate on everything)
   - **Need**: Lower threshold test to see where failures emerge

---

## What Still Needs Testing

### High Priority

1. **Paraphrases** (different wording, same meaning):
   - "The capital of the state containing Dallas" 
   - "The seat of government for the state where Dallas is located"
   - "Dallas is in a state whose capital is Austin"

2. **Cross-Domain Swaps**:
   - Geography -> Science: "Dallas is in Texas" vs "Hydrogen is in water"
   - People -> Places: "Michael Jordan plays basketball" vs "Sacramento hosts government"

3. **Failure Mode Analysis**:
   - What happens when we use unrelated entities?
   - "The capital of Texas" vs "The opposite of hot"
   - Hypothesis: Survival rate should drop

### Medium Priority

4. **Grammatical Reorderings**:
   - "Austin is the capital of Texas"
   - "Texas, whose capital is Austin"
   - "The state of Texas has Austin as its capital"

5. **Feature-Specific Analysis**:
   - Which feature types are most robust? (Semantic vs Relationship vs Say-X)
   - Do early-layer features survive better than late-layer?

## Conclusion for Publication

### Recommended Statement

> "We evaluate cross-prompt robustness by testing feature survival across entity swaps. Using the Dallas->Austin (Texas capital) and Oakland->Sacramento (California capital) circuits, we find that 25/25 common features (100%) survive with activation overlap >=70%. Features maintain identical layer distributions (mean KS p-value = 1.000) and exhibit appropriate concept shifts (96% peak token consistency), with semantic features shifting to new entities while functional tokens remain stable. However, these results are limited to structurally similar prompts within the same semantic domain. Further testing with paraphrases, reorderings, and cross-domain swaps is needed to fully validate robustness claims."

### Key Numbers

- **Survival Rate**: 100% (25/25 features, threshold >=70% overlap)
- **Activation Overlap**: 1.000 +/- 0.000 (perfect)
- **Peak Token Consistency**: 96% +/- 20% (concept shifts work)
- **Layer Stability**: 100% (all features p>0.05)

### Honest Framing

**This is a strong positive result with important caveats:**

‚úÖ **What we can claim**:
- Features survive entity swaps within the same semantic structure
- Concept alignment shifts appropriately
- Layer roles are stable

‚ö†Ô∏è **What we cannot claim yet**:
- Robustness to paraphrases
- Robustness to grammatical variations
- Robustness across semantic domains

üî¨ **What we need next**:
- Test paraphrases and reorderings
- Test cross-domain generalization
- Analyze the non-overlapping features (why aren't they common?)

## Appendix: Why 100% Survival?

### Hypothesis 1: Truly Robust Features
Features genuinely represent abstract concepts (e.g., "capital-of" relationship) that generalize across entity instantiations.

**Evidence**: Peak token consistency at 96% suggests features do shift appropriately.

### Hypothesis 2: Similar Prompt Structure
Prompts are very similar structurally, so features naturally align.

**Evidence**: Identical grammatical templates, same token positions.

### Hypothesis 3: General Features
Features might be activated by broad patterns rather than specific entities.

**Test needed**: Check activation sparsity. If features activate on everything, that's a red flag.

### Verdict
Likely a combination of all three. The 100% result is impressive but needs validation on more diverse prompts.
