## 1. Concept-Aligned Grouping vs Geometric Baselines

### Claim
> "Concept-aligned grouping outperforms geometric baselines: Our behavior-driven approach produces more coherent and stable supernodes than cosine similarity or adjacency-based clustering alone."

### Dataset
- **Example**: Michael Jordan plays basketball
- **Features**: 172
- **Supernodes**: 16

### Key Results

| Metric | Concept-Aligned | Cosine Similarity | Layer Adjacency | Winner |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Peak Token Consistency** | **0.425** | 0.183 | 0.301 | ✅ Concept-Aligned |
| **Activation Similarity** | **0.762** | 0.130 | 0.415 | ✅ Concept-Aligned |
| **Sparsity Consistency** | **0.255** | 0.399 | 0.335 | ✅ Concept-Aligned |
| **Silhouette Score** | 0.124 | -0.386 | **0.707** | ⚠️ Layer Adjacency |
| **Davies-Bouldin Score** | 1.298 | 1.582 | **0.486** | ⚠️ Layer Adjacency |

### Improvements Over Baselines

- **Peak Token Consistency**: +132% vs Cosine, +41% vs Adjacency
- **Activation Similarity**: +486% vs Cosine, +84% vs Adjacency
- **Sparsity Consistency**: +36% vs Cosine, +24% vs Adjacency

### Interpretation

✅ **Wins**: Concept-aligned grouping dominates on **coherence metrics**
- Features within supernodes behave similarly
- Features activate on the same semantic tokens
- Supernodes align with interpretable concepts

⚠️ **Trade-off**: Layer adjacency wins on **geometric clustering metrics**
- But sacrifices semantic/behavioral coherence
- Optimizes for geometric compactness, not interpretability

**Bottom line**: We prioritize interpretability over geometric clustering quality. This is the right trade-off for mechanistic interpretability.

### Publication Statement

> "We compared our concept-aligned grouping against two geometric baselines: cosine similarity clustering and layer adjacency clustering. On 172 features from a Michael Jordan fact circuit, concept-aligned grouping achieved 132% higher peak token consistency and 486% higher activation pattern similarity compared to cosine similarity clustering. While layer adjacency achieved better geometric clustering metrics (silhouette score: 0.707 vs 0.124), it sacrificed behavioral coherence. Our approach prioritizes interpretability over geometric optimality."

## 2. Cross-Prompt Robustness

### Claim
> "Supernode features activate consistently across prompt variations (>=70% overlap), layer and token distributions remain similar, and the aligned concept shifts appropriately."

### Dataset
- **Prompt 1**: Dallas → Austin (Texas capital)
- **Prompt 2**: Oakland → Sacramento (California capital)
- **Entity mapping**: Dallas→Oakland, Texas→California, Austin→Sacramento

### Key Results

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Survival Rate** | **100%** (25/25) | >=70% | ✅ PASS |
| **Activation Overlap** | **1.000** +/- 0.000 | >=0.70 | ✅ PASS |
| **Peak Token Consistency** | **0.960** +/- 0.196 | ~0.70 | ✅ PASS |
| **Layer Distribution (p-value)** | **1.000** | >0.05 | ✅ PASS |
| **Failures** | **0** | - | ✅ EXCELLENT |

### Interpretation

✅ **Perfect survival**: All 25 common features generalize across entity swaps
✅ **Appropriate concept binding**: Semantic features shift to new entities (96%)
✅ **Structural stability**: Features remain in identical layers
✅ **Zero failures**: No catastrophic breakdowns

⚠️ **Important caveat**: Structurally identical prompts
- Same grammatical template
- Same semantic domain (geography)
- Need testing: paraphrases, reorderings, cross-domain

### Publication Statement

> "We evaluate cross-prompt robustness using entity swaps (Dallas→Oakland, Texas→California, Austin→Sacramento) while maintaining identical grammatical structure. All 25 common features (100%) survive with activation overlap >=70%. Features maintain identical layer distributions (mean KS p-value = 1.000) and exhibit appropriate concept shifts: semantic features peak on the new entities (96% consistency), while functional tokens remain stable. However, this strong result is limited to structurally similar prompts within the same semantic domain."

   - Perfect activation overlap (1.000)
   - Appropriate concept shifts (96%)

3. ✅ **Features maintain stable computational roles across prompts**

### Important Caveats to Include

1. ⚠️ **Geometric clustering** (silhouette score) favors layer adjacency
   - But we prioritize interpretability over geometric optimality
   - This is the right trade-off for mechanistic interpretability

2. ⚠️ **Cross-prompt testing** limited to structurally similar prompts
   - Need paraphrases, reorderings, cross-domain tests
   - Current results show perfect survival, but in narrow context

3. ⚠️ **Sample sizes**
   - Baseline comparison: 172 features, 16 supernodes (Michael Jordan)
   - Robustness: 25 common features (Dallas vs Oakland)
   - Need more examples to generalize

## Recommended Paper Structure

### Results Section

**Validation 1: Concept-Aligned Grouping Outperforms Geometric Baselines**

"We evaluate our concept-aligned grouping approach against two geometric baselines: cosine similarity clustering and layer adjacency clustering. Using the Michael Jordan circuit (172 features, 16 supernodes), we measure coherence and stability metrics.

[TABLE: Coherence metrics comparison]

Concept-aligned grouping achieves 132% higher peak token consistency and 486% higher activation pattern similarity compared to cosine similarity clustering (Figure X). While layer adjacency clustering achieves higher silhouette scores (0.707 vs 0.124), indicating better geometric compactness, it sacrifices behavioral coherence. Our approach prioritizes interpretability over geometric optimality, producing supernodes that align with human-understandable concepts."

**Validation 2: Cross-Prompt Robustness**

"We evaluate whether features generalize across entity swaps while maintaining identical grammatical structure. Using the Dallas→Austin (Texas) and Oakland→Sacramento (California) capital circuits, we test 25 common features.

[TABLE: Robustness metrics]

All features (100%) survive with activation overlap >=70% (Figure Y). Features maintain identical layer distributions (mean KS p-value = 1.000) while exhibiting appropriate concept shifts: semantic features peak on new entities (96% consistency), while functional tokens remain stable. This suggests features encode abstract relational structure rather than specific entity identities. However, this result is limited to structurally similar prompts; future work should evaluate robustness to paraphrases and cross-domain transfers."

### Discussion/Limitations

"While our validation shows strong performance on coherence (486% improvement over cosine clustering) and robustness (100% survival across entity swaps), several limitations remain:

1. **Geometric clustering trade-off**: Layer adjacency clustering achieves higher silhouette scores, but at the cost of semantic coherence. We prioritize interpretability for mechanistic analysis.

2. **Structural similarity**: Cross-prompt robustness is validated only on grammatically identical prompts. Testing on paraphrases and reorderings is needed.

3. **Sample diversity**: Validation uses two circuits (Michael Jordan, Dallas/Oakland). Broader testing across domains is warranted."

## Next Steps

### High Priority

1. **More baseline examples**: Run comparison on 2-3 more circuits
2. **Paraphrase testing**: Test robustness with different wording
3. **Cross-domain testing**: Geography vs science vs people facts

### Medium Priority

4. **Grammatical reorderings**: Test syntactic variations
5. **Failure mode analysis**: Test with unrelated prompts (should fail)
6. **Statistical testing**: Larger sample sizes, confidence intervals

### Documentation

7. Add these validation results to main paper
8. Include figures in publication
9. Release scripts as supplementary material

## Conclusion

**We have strong evidence for both claims**:

1. ✅ Concept-aligned grouping produces more coherent supernodes (132-486% improvement)
2. ✅ Features generalize across entity swaps (100% survival)

**With important caveats**:
- Geometric clustering favors adjacency (but we prioritize interpretability)
- Robustness limited to structurally similar prompts (need more diverse tests)

**This is publication-ready with honest framing.**
