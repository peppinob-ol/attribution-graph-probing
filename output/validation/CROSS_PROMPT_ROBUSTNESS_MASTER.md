## 🎯 Two Complementary Methods

We validate robustness at **two levels** - both essential for comprehensive validation:

### 1. **Feature-Level Robustness** (Computational Stability)
📂 Directory: `feature_level_robustness/`

**Question**: Do individual SAE features maintain stable activation patterns across entity swaps?

**Method**:
- Identifies 25 features common to both probes
- Measures **activation overlap**: fraction of token positions that overlap
- Calculates **survival rate**: how many features have overlap ≥70%
- Tests layer distribution stability (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)

**Key Results**:
- ✅ **Survival Rate**: 100% (25/25 features)
- ✅ **Activation Overlap**: 1.000 (perfect)
- ✅ **Peak Token Consistency**: 96%
- ✅ **Layer Distribution**: p=1.000 (stable)

**Interpretation**: Features are computationally stable - they activate in the same patterns even when entities change.

**Script**: `scripts/experiments/cross_prompt_robustness.py`

### 2. **Supernode-Level Robustness** (Semantic Disentanglement)
📂 Directory: `supernode_level_robustness/`

**Question**: Do conceptual groupings (supernodes) transfer appropriately across entity swaps?

**Method**:
- Identifies supernodes (conceptual groups) in each probe
- Classifies as: Universal (should transfer) / Entity-specific (shouldn't transfer) / Output
- Verifies transfer patterns match expectations
- Analyzes grouping consistency for shared features

**Key Results**:
- ✅ **Universal Transfer**: 100% (7/7 supernodes transferred)
- ✅ **Entity Separation**: 100% (8/8 appropriately did NOT transfer)
- ✅ **Activation Stability**: 94% (for shared features)
- ✅ **Grouping Consistency**: 96% (corrected for entity-dependence)

**Interpretation**: Concepts are semantically disentangled - universal concepts transfer, entity-specific concepts don't (as they should).

**Script**: `scripts/experiments/analyze_cross_prompt_robustness.py`

## 🔬 Why Both Methods Matter

| Aspect | Feature-Level | Supernode-Level |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Validates** | Computational robustness | Semantic robustness |
| **Granularity** | Fine (individual features) | Coarse (conceptual groups) |
| **Question** | "Do features fire consistently?" | "Are concepts organized correctly?" |
| **Evidence for** | Technical stability | Conceptual disentanglement |
| **Audience** | Mechanistic interpretability | Cognitive science |
| **Failure mode** | Spurious activation patterns | Concept bleeding / poor grouping |

### They're Complementary:
- ✅ **Feature-level passes** → Features are robust computational units
- ✅ **Supernode-level passes** → Features group into meaningful concepts
- 🎯 **Both pass** → Pipeline discovers real, stable, interpretable concepts

## 📊 Combined Results for Paper

### Abstract / Intro
> "We validate robustness through dual-level testing: at the feature level, all 25 common features (100%) maintained stable activation patterns (overlap=1.000) across entity swaps; at the supernode level, universal concepts showed perfect transfer (7/7, 100%) while entity-specific concepts exhibited perfect appropriate non-transfer (8/8, 100%)."

### Results Section 5.5

**Paragraph 1: Feature-Level Robustness**
> To assess computational stability, we tested whether individual SAE features maintain consistent activation patterns across entity swaps (Dallas→Oakland, Texas→California, Austin→Sacramento). All 25 common features (100%) survived with activation overlap ≥70% (mean=1.000, perfect stability). Features maintained identical layer distributions (mean Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value=1.000) while appropriately shifting peak tokens to new entities (96% consistency).

**Paragraph 2: Supernode-Level Robustness**  
> At the conceptual level, we verified whether supernode groupings transfer appropriately. Universal concept supernodes demonstrated perfect transfer (7/7 including copula, prepositions, relational operators), while entity-specific supernodes showed perfect appropriate non-transfer (8/8 including state and city names). Shared features exhibited 94% activation stability (mean relative difference 0.058) and 96% correct grouping behavior (68% consistently grouped as universal, 28% appropriately entity-dependent).

**Paragraph 3: Interpretation**
> These dual-level results provide converging evidence against overfitting: features are computationally stable (perfect activation overlap) while concepts are semantically disentangled (perfect transfer discrimination). The combination of feature-level stability and supernode-level organization demonstrates that the pipeline discovers genuine, generalizable representations rather than probe-specific artifacts.

### Discussion
> The perfect discrimination at both levels (100% feature survival, 100% supernode transfer/non-transfer) provides strong validation. If the method captured spurious patterns, we would expect either: (1) features to activate inconsistently (feature-level failure), or (2) concepts to inappropriately transfer (supernode-level failure). Instead, we observe both computational stability and semantic disentanglement.

## 🔬 Methodology Comparison

### Feature-Level Method (Activation Overlap)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Direct measurement of activation stability
- ✅ Statistical testing (KS test for distributions)
- ✅ Clear survival threshold (70%)
- ✅ Position-level granularity

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️ Doesn't test semantic organization
- ⚠️ Can't distinguish universal vs entity features
- ⚠️ Limited to features that appear in both probes

**Best for**: Proving computational robustness

---

### Supernode-Level Method (Concept Transfer)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Tests semantic disentanglement
- ✅ Discriminates universal vs entity-specific
- ✅ Validates grouping algorithm
- ✅ Conceptually interpretable

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️ Requires manual categorization (universal/entity)
- ⚠️ Grouping consistency needs interpretation (entity-dependence)
- ⚠️ Coarser granularity than feature-level

**Best for**: Proving semantic robustness

---

## ⚠️ Important Distinctions

### Don't Confuse:
❌ "Feature survival" (method 1) ≠ "Supernode transfer" (method 2)  
❌ "Activation overlap" (method 1) ≠ "Activation stability" (method 2)  
❌ "Peak token consistency" (both use this, but different contexts)

### Do Emphasize:
✅ Both methods converge on the same conclusion: concepts are robust  
✅ Complementary validation at different levels of abstraction  
✅ Combined evidence is stronger than either alone
