## 🎯 Changes Made

### ✅ 1. Renamed Directories (Clarity)
- ❌ `cross prompt` → ✅ `feature_level_robustness`
- ❌ `cross_prompt_2` → ✅ `supernode_level_robustness`

**Rationale**: Names now clearly indicate what each method measures.

### ✅ 2. Created Master Overview
- **`CROSS_PROMPT_ROBUSTNESS_MASTER.md`** - Explains both methods and how they complement each other

### ✅ 3. Added Method Summaries
- `feature_level_robustness/_METHOD_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference for Method 1
- `supernode_level_robustness/_METHOD_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference for Method 2

### ✅ 4. Updated Navigation
- **`INDEX.md`** - Complete directory index with clear navigation paths

## 📖 Two Complementary Methods Explained

### Method 1: Feature-Level Robustness
📂 `feature_level_robustness/`

**Question**: Do features maintain stable activation patterns?  
**Method**: Activation overlap analysis  
**Granularity**: Fine (25 individual features)  
**Validates**: Computational stability

**Key Results**:
- ✅ 100% survival rate (25/25)
- ✅ Perfect activation overlap (1.000)
- ✅ 96% peak token consistency
- ✅ Stable layer distributions (p=1.000)

**Paper Section**: "At the feature level, we tested..."

---

### Method 2: Supernode-Level Robustness
📂 `supernode_level_robustness/`

**Question**: Do concepts transfer/separate appropriately?  
**Method**: Supernode transfer analysis  
**Granularity**: Coarse (7-8 conceptual groups)  
**Validates**: Semantic disentanglement

**Key Results**:
- ✅ 100% universal transfer (7/7)
- ✅ 100% entity separation (8/8)
- ✅ 94% activation stability
- ✅ 96% grouping consistency

**Paper Section**: "At the supernode level, we verified..."

## ✅ What to Say in Paper

### Abstract (Combined)
> "We validate robustness through dual-level testing: at the feature level, all 25 common features (100%) maintained stable activation patterns (overlap=1.000); at the supernode level, universal concepts showed perfect transfer (7/7, 100%) while entity-specific concepts exhibited perfect appropriate non-transfer (8/8, 100%)."

### Results Section 5.5

**Paragraph 1: Feature-Level**
> "At the feature level, we tested whether individual SAE features maintain consistent activation patterns across entity swaps (Dallas→Oakland, Texas→California, Austin→Sacramento). All 25 common features (100%) survived with activation overlap ≥70% (mean=1.000, perfect stability). Features maintained identical layer distributions (mean Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value=1.000) while appropriately shifting peak tokens to new entities (96% consistency)."

**Paragraph 2: Supernode-Level**  
> "At the supernode level, we verified whether conceptual groupings transfer appropriately. Universal concept supernodes demonstrated perfect transfer (7/7 including copula, prepositions, relational operators), while entity-specific supernodes showed perfect appropriate non-transfer (8/8 including state and city names). Shared features exhibited 94% activation stability (mean relative difference 0.058) and 96% correct grouping behavior (68% consistently grouped as universal, 28% appropriately entity-dependent)."

**Paragraph 3: Interpretation**
> "These dual-level results provide converging evidence against overfitting: features are computationally stable (perfect activation overlap) while concepts are semantically disentangled (perfect transfer discrimination). The combination of feature-level stability and supernode-level organization demonstrates that the pipeline discovers genuine, generalizable representations rather than probe-specific artifacts."

## 🔬 Why Both Methods Matter

| Validates | Feature-Level | Supernode-Level | Together |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Technical robustness** | ✅ Yes | - | ✅ Strong |
| **Semantic organization** | - | ✅ Yes | ✅ Strong |
| **Against overfitting** | ✅ Partial | ✅ Partial | ✅ Complete |
| **Concept discovery** | ⚠️ Indirect | ✅ Direct | ✅ Comprehensive |

**Single method** = Good evidence  
**Both methods** = Converging evidence = Stronger claim

## ⚠️ Important Distinctions

### Don't Mix the Methods!

When citing, be specific:
- ✅ "Feature-level survival rate: 100%"
- ✅ "Supernode-level transfer rate: 100%"
- ❌ "Cross-prompt transfer rate: 100%" (ambiguous!)

### Understand What Each Measures

**Feature-Level**:
- Do features fire in same positions? → Yes (overlap=1.000)

**Supernode-Level**:
- Do concepts organize correctly? → Yes (100% transfer/separation)

**They're different questions!**
