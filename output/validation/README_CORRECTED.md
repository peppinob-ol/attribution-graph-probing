# Validation Results - Corrected After Statistical Review

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This Supersedes Previous Results

**Original validation had critical flaws**:
1. ❌ No statistical tests (baseline comparison)
2. ❌ Selection bias (100% survival was wrong)
3. ❌ Overgeneralization (small sample)

**This folder contains CORRECTED analyses.**

## 📊 Corrected Key Results

### 1. Baseline Comparison (Unchanged Numbers, Better Framing)
- Peak Consistency: 0.425 vs 0.183 (concept vs cosine)
- **NEW FRAMING**: "Numerical advantages" (not "outperforms")
- **CAVEAT**: No statistical significance tests
- **TRADE-OFF**: Loses on silhouette score (0.124 vs 0.707)

### 2. Cross-Prompt Robustness (MAJOR CORRECTION)
- **OLD (WRONG)**: 100% survival (25/25 common features)
- **NEW (CORRECT)**: 64.1% survival (25/39 all Dallas features)
- **BONUS INSIGHT**: Layer stratification (early transfer, late fail)
- **Statistical test**: p=0.054 (marginally non-significant vs 50%)

## 🔑 Critical Changes

### What Changed

| Claim | Original | Corrected |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Baseline** | "Outperforms baselines" | "Numerical advantages" |
| **Survival Rate** | "100% (25/25)" | "64.1% (25/39)" |
| **Significance** | Implied | "No significance tests" |
| **Generalization** | "Features generalize" | "Preliminary results suggest..." |

### Why It Changed

**Baseline**: No statistical tests → can't claim "outperforms"
**Survival**: Selection bias → tested only common features
**Sample Size**: n=1-2 → can't claim broad generalization

## 📝 Publication-Ready Text

### Abstract (Use This)
```
Preliminary validation (n=2 circuits) suggests concept-aligned grouping 
captures behavioral coherence better than geometric baselines on 
interpretability metrics (peak consistency: 0.425 vs 0.183), though at 
the cost of geometric clustering quality (silhouette: 0.124 vs 0.707). 
Entity swap experiments show 64% of features transfer to structurally 
similar prompts, with early-layer features (L=6.3) generalizing more 
than late-layer ones (L=16.4). Further testing needed.
```

### Key Numbers
- **Baseline**: Peak 0.425 vs 0.183 (no significance test)
- **Robustness**: **64.1% survival** (25/39 features, p=0.054)
- **Layer Pattern**: Transferred L=6.3, Failed L=16.4

### Limitations (Include This)
```
Validation uses 1-2 examples per claim. Statistical significance testing 
not performed. Cross-prompt testing used structurally identical prompts 
only. 36% failure rate indicates prompt-specific components. Larger-scale 
validation and diverse prompt testing needed.
```

## ✅ What We Can Claim (Honest)

1. ✅ "Numerical advantages on behavioral metrics" (descriptive)
2. ✅ "64% of features transferred" (true survival rate)
3. ✅ "Early features generalize, late don't" (layer pattern)
4. ✅ "Preliminary results suggest..." (small sample caveat)
5. ✅ "Further testing needed" (honest limitation)

---

## ❌ What We CANNOT Claim

1. ❌ "Outperforms baselines" (no significance tests)
2. ❌ "100% survival" (selection bias)
3. ❌ "Features are robust" (qualified: 64%, structure-dependent)
4. ❌ "Method generalizes" (n=1-2 examples)
5. ❌ "Statistically significant" (no tests performed)

## 🎯 Novel Insight (Actually Interesting!)

### Layer Stratification Pattern
**Transferred features**: Mean layer 6.3 (early/mid)
**Failed features**: Mean layer 16.4 (late)

**Interpretation**:
- Early layers: Abstract, generalizable representations
- Late layers: Context-specific, prompt-dependent
- This is a **scientifically valuable finding**

**Why 64% is better than 100%**:
- 100% was suspicious (selection bias)
- 64% shows realistic mix of core + specific features
- Layer pattern is novel insight
- Honest result builds credibility

## 📊 Visualizations (Need Updates)

### OLD (Incorrect)
- `robustness_summary.png` - Shows 100% (WRONG)
- `entity_mapping_diagram.png` - Shows 100% (WRONG)

### TODO
- Update to show 64% survival rate
- Add layer stratification chart
- Add failure mode analysis

---

## 🔬 What Still Needs Doing

### Before Publication

1. ⚠️ **Statistical tests** (high priority)
   - t-tests for baseline comparison
   - Effect sizes (Cohen's d)
   - Confidence intervals

2. ⚠️ **Update visualizations** (high priority)
   - Fix 100% → 64%
   - Add layer pattern chart
   - Add failure analysis

3. ✅ **Fix text** (DONE)
   - Corrected claims
   - Added limitations
   - Honest framing

### For Follow-Up Work

4. 📊 **More examples** (≥5 circuits)
5. 📊 **Paraphrase testing**
6. 📊 **Cross-domain validation**
7. 📊 **Statistical validation**

## 🤝 Acknowledgment

This correction was prompted by a rigorous statistical review that identified:
1. Selection bias in robustness testing
2. Missing significance tests
3. Overgeneralization from small samples

**The critique was valid and improved the science.**

**Key lesson**: Honest limitations > overstated claims
