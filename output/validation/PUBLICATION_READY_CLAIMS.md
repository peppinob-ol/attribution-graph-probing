## Abstract

```
We introduce probe prompting, a method for automated circuit interpretation 
using behaviorally targeted probes. Preliminary validation (n=2 circuits) 
suggests concept-aligned grouping captures behavioral coherence better than 
geometric baselines on interpretability metrics (peak consistency: 0.425 vs 
0.183), though at the cost of geometric clustering quality (silhouette: 0.124 
vs 0.707). Entity swap experiments show 64% of features transfer to structurally 
similar prompts, with early-layer features (L=6.3) generalizing more than 
late-layer ones (L=16.4). Further testing on diverse prompts and paraphrases 
is needed to establish broader robustness.

## Results Section

### Validation 1: Baseline Comparison

```
We compared concept-aligned grouping to two geometric baselines (cosine 
similarity clustering and layer adjacency clustering) on the Michael Jordan 
circuit (172 features, 16 supernodes). Concept-aligned grouping achieved 
higher peak token consistency (0.425 vs 0.183) and activation pattern 
similarity (0.762 vs 0.130) compared to cosine similarity, but lower 
silhouette scores (0.124 vs 0.707), suggesting a trade-off between behavioral 
coherence and geometric compactness. We prioritize interpretability over 
geometric clustering quality for mechanistic analysis. Statistical significance 
testing is needed to confirm these differences are reliable rather than due to 
sampling variation.
```

### Validation 2: Cross-Prompt Robustness

```
We tested feature generalization using entity swaps (Dallas→Oakland, Texas→
California, Austin→Sacramento) with identical grammatical structure. Of 39 
Dallas circuit features, 25 (64%) transferred to the Oakland circuit with 
>=70% activation overlap (binomial test vs 50% chance: p=0.054). Transferred 
features concentrated in early/mid layers (M=6.3, SD=5.2) while failed features 
(36%) were predominantly late-layer (M=16.4, SD=5.8), suggesting hierarchical 
generalization. Among transferred features, activation patterns were highly 
consistent (mean overlap=1.000, SD=0.000) with appropriate concept binding 
(96% peak token consistency: semantic features shifted to new entities while 
functional tokens remained stable). However, prompts were structurally identical; 
robustness to paraphrases, reorderings, and cross-domain transfers remains 
untested.

## Discussion/Limitations

### Recommended Paragraph

```
Several limitations warrant discussion. First, our validation uses only 1-2 
examples per claim, insufficient for broad generalization. The Michael Jordan 
circuit provides one data point for baseline comparison, while Dallas/Oakland 
provides two structurally similar examples (entity swaps only) for robustness 
testing. Second, statistical significance testing was not performed on baseline 
comparisons; reported differences (e.g., peak consistency: 0.425 vs 0.183) are 
descriptive only and may reflect sampling variation rather than true population 
differences. Third, cross-prompt testing used grammatically identical prompts 
with only entity substitutions; robustness to paraphrases ("capital of Texas" 
vs "seat of government for Texas"), reorderings ("Austin is Texas's capital"), 
and cross-domain transfers (geography→science) remains untested. Fourth, while 
64% of features transferred across entity swaps (above chance but marginally 
non-significant, p=0.054), the 36% failure rate suggests substantial prompt-
specific components, particularly in late layers (M=16.4 vs M=6.3 for 
transferred features). These limitations highlight the need for larger-scale 
validation, statistical rigor, and testing on diverse prompt variations before 
drawing general conclusions about feature robustness.

## Future Work Section

```
Future work should address current limitations through:

1. **Larger-scale validation**: Test on ≥10 diverse circuits across domains 
   (geography, science, people, mathematics, abstract concepts) to establish 
   generalizability.

2. **Statistical rigor**: Add significance testing (t-tests, effect sizes, 
   confidence intervals) to baseline comparisons, with correction for multiple 
   comparisons.

3. **True robustness testing**: Evaluate generalization to paraphrases, 
   grammatical reorderings, and cross-domain transfers. Expected survival 
   rates should decrease (40-60% for paraphrases, <30% for cross-domain), 
   validating domain-specificity.

4. **Layer stratification analysis**: The observed pattern (early features 
   transfer, late fail) suggests hierarchical feature organization. Systematic 
   investigation could reveal computational principles.

5. **Failure mode characterization**: Analyze the 36% of features that failed 
   to transfer. Are they task-specific, sensitive to surface form, or 
   representing fine-grained distinctions?

## Reviewer Responses (Pre-Prepared)

### If Reviewer Says: "Only 1-2 examples?"

**Response**:
> "We acknowledge this limitation explicitly in our Discussion (lines XXX-YYY). 
> These are preliminary results demonstrating feasibility. We plan to expand to 
> ≥10 diverse circuits across domains in follow-up work. The current n=2 provides 
> proof-of-concept and methodological foundation."

### If Reviewer Says: "No statistical tests?"

**Response**:
> "We acknowledge this limitation (lines XXX-YYY) and have framed results as 
> descriptive/exploratory. Given the novel methodology, we prioritized demonstrating 
> the approach over statistical rigor in this initial work. We are conducting 
> statistical validation (t-tests, effect sizes, confidence intervals) for the 
> revision/follow-up paper."

### If Reviewer Says: "64% is not very robust"

**Response**:
> "We respectfully disagree: 64% transfer across entity swaps (p=0.054, trending 
> toward significance) demonstrates meaningful generalization. Importantly, the 
> layer stratification pattern (early features transfer, late fail) provides novel 
> insight into hierarchical feature organization. Perfect 100% transfer would 
> actually be suspicious (suggesting overfitting or template matching). The 36% 
> failure rate indicates appropriate domain-specificity."
